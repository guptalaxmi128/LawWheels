                        <strong>The Cycle of Violence</strong> <br />
                        The cycle of violence explains why many victims stay in
                        abusive relationships. It describes the phases an
                        abusive relationship goes through, from tension building
                        to the actual violent event, and the reconciliation that
                        follows. Understanding this cycle can help explain why
                        leaving an abusive relationship can be difficult.
